<h1>FREERIDE 350</h1>
<div>Freedom has a name: on the <strong>FREERIDE 350</strong>, only the rider determines the route. In its two years on the market, it impressed everyone who had always wanted to ride offroad "for the heck of it", without any pressure to perform. For the upcoming model year, KTM is focussing clearly with its further refinement of the FREERIDE 350 on increased all-round potential and enhanced suitability for everyday use. For example, an extended top gear and a longer final transmission ratio lower the revs and reduce fuel consumption along highway sections, while the shortened five lower gears as ever guarantee optimum power delivery offroad. Numerous optimized details further improve the durability and reliability of the new FREERIDE 350 and contribute to reducing its already extraordinarily low weight even further

      <h2 id="ENGINE">ENGINE</h2>
      <p>The engine on the FREERIDE 350 is based on the successful power unit of the 350 EXC-F. Nevertheless, it has been optimized for the most harmonious torque progression possible. The crankshaft drives a laterally positioned intermediate shaft that also acts as a balancer shaft, water pump and timing chain drive for the two camshafts. An exhaust camshaft with optimized auto-decompression ensures improved starting behavior. The four steel valves, with reinforced spring retainers, are actuated by two overhead camshafts and DLC-coated cam followers. In conjunction with the gasket, a water-pump cover guarantees easier fitting and better sealing, even in extreme temperatures. Well-protected behind the cylinder, the electric starter is equipped with a reinforced freewheel. With state-of-the-art, closed-loop lambda control, the Keihin engine management system, featuring electronic fuel injection and 42-millimetre throttle valve diameter, ensures efficient exhaust gas purification by the two catalytic converters and very low fuel consumption for an offroad bike. Additional engine characteristics can be activated with an optional PowerParts map-select switch.</p>

<p> The 6-speed transmission specially designed for the FREERIDE models is characterised by shorter transmission ratios in the five lower gears, while the long sixth gear guarantees more relaxed revs on the road.</p>

      <h2 id="CRANCKSHAFT">CRANCKSHAFT</h2>
<p>The 350Â cc engine is equipped with a crankshaft which features a plain bearing in the lower conrod eye. This technology guarantees higher durability and allows service intervals for the crankshaft to be extended.</p>
      <h2 id="CSS CLUTCH">CSS CLUTCH</h2>
<p>The undamped CSS clutch and the Formula hydraulic system not only impress with high durability and low weight, they also ensure optimum disengagement and precise control. A revamped outer clutch hub is employed and contributes to the weight reduction.
